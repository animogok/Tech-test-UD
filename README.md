### Modules
I made two modules; 
- register_login: This is one service that got 2 differents usages, due to the lack of understanding requirements. The first usage correspond to the manage of users meaning login and register and the second usage it's the user management of own made sport events
- sport-event: This one it's under construction, the main purpose was to connect the API-Football to make bets (this one was the main reason to register_login to have 2 usages)
